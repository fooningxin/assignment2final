The aerial part revolves around one partner (the base) supporting the other (the flyer) in flying through the air in a sequenced series of yoga postures. For foundation practice, students must learn to be the active role to make sure both the base and the aerial person remain safe and exercise proper yoga postures alignment for the session. Benefits of the ACROVINYASA include increased strength, endurance and stamina while cultivating a strong and powerful sense of trust and reliance between both partners.

<h3>Cardio-Kickboxing Training</h3>
<p>Cardio-kickboxing is an integration of kickboxing techniques and fitness concepts that keeps you on your toes with a great workout despite reducing the fight sparring element. Combining hand-eye coordination, core control and cathartic moves, the exercises also improve speed, agility, reflexes and stamina. On your feet through out and engaging all major muscles, this high-power, high-energy cardio routine will burn up to 900 calories in an hour to achieve weight loss and improved body strength.
<br>Your personal trainer will create a workout at the training intensity level that suits your current fitness level, as cardio-kickboxing may be strenuous for someone who usually has a low level of activity, then the intensity will be raised as you progress and get stronger.
</p>

<h3>VibroGym Training</h3>
<p>VibroGym training is a form of fitness training where you exercise on an equipment that vibrates during the work out. Generating vertical vibrations that are transferred to your body, the natural balance of the body is interrupted so to recover this balance, the muscles of the body will be stimulated immediately. Vibrations that vary with settings in high and low frequencies during exercise are created to help you reach a full body workout more effectively. VibroGym training is especially suitable for those who seek a low impact workout yet giving maximum results.
<br>Personal trainers will create a suitable frequency and workout combination for your fitness level and goals. Higher frequencies help to relax the muscles for effective warm up and cool down, whilst lower frequencies help to increase muscle strength and tone as muscles are contracting more powerfully.
